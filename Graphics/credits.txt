Image of player's ship came with the materials provided me for this assignment.  I do not know
its source, but I have modified it to suit my needs. The same is true of the picture of the meteor/asteroid.

The images of the alien ships I drew myself (Galen Cochrane).

The images of the projectiles (bullets) are also my own work, as are the images of the alien ships' shields and their little red broadcast signal things.

The images presented in the level loading screens are also my own work, except where the picture of the meteor is shown once.
