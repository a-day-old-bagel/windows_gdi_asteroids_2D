  The year is 2099.  Humanity has just been
 rocked by news that a group of spacefaring
    terrorists has hijacked the Lunar Orbital
   Laser mining platform, killing hundreds of
workers.  The terrorists are now cutting huge
   chunks out of the moon and hurling them
towards Earth.  One such lunar meteorite has
         already devastated half of Tokyo.

You are one of the only miners to survive the
 hijacking.  You were on the other side of the
     moon on a prospecting mission when it
   happened. Now, alone in your little craft,
 armed only with the graviton gun you use for
   breaking apart bedrock, you are the last
       obstacle to the terrorists' designs.

   A cloud of deadly meteoroids is leaving the
 moon's orbit, en route to Earth.  Can you stop
             them? Can you save us all?
